- For each file, switch turns with your partner
- One of you will navitage: 'explain what to do'
- The other will drive: 'Write the code'
- In your app.rb, create a '/' route
- Return a Hash.to_json of data about your team 
- Create two additional routes 
- '/first_person'
- '/second_person'
- These routes should return a Hash to JSON about each person.
